# XLStoSQL
An XLS or XLSX data translator to SQL INPUT row sequences. Works with multiple sheets on same Excel.
## Usage
Just run python XLStoSQL.py and follow instructions carefully. If some input contains a typo it will crush. I will try to solve exceptions as soon as possible. When script finishes, it otputs the SQL commands on a text file, you have to specify the name and route but not the extension (again follow instructions).
